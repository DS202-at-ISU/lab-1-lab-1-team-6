# Lab report \#1

Follow the instructions posted at
<https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs.html> for the lab assignment. The
work is meant to be finished during the lab time, but you have time
until Monday evening to polish things.

Include your answers in this document (Rmd file). Make sure that it
knits properly (into the md file). Upload both the Rmd and the md file
to your repository.

All submissions to the github repo will be automatically uploaded for
grading once the due date is passed. Submit a link to your repository on
Canvas (only one submission per team) to signal to the instructors that
you are done with your submission.

Simeon: It went smoothly and we had no problems with anything involving
Git or RStudio.

Keegan: I’ve already used Git before, but adding the repository to
RStudio was very simple. Then committing/pushing was also seamless.

Nick: I got everything set up pretty easy

Nick: I didn’t wind up running into any errors - I already had git and
RStudio set up earlier this week, but I did have some small trouble
finding the UI options for git within RStudio.

Nick: I think we were meant to run into merge conflicts? Either we
managed our pulls/pushes very well or got very lucky and didn’t run into
anything that wasn’t very easy to solve.

Nick: Oh ok. I messed around with this file a bit more after class and
knitted to the .md per specs and got some conflicts when committing. Git
seemed to do a good enough job of selecting sections to add or delete so
it really didn’t need much from me.
